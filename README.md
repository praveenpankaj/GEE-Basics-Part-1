# Geospatial AI Fundamentals for Agriculture and Environment

This tutorial is an extension of a conference tutorial on Google Earth Engine (GEE). 

---

## 📖 Overview

This repository is an extension of a conference tutorial and focuses on leveraging **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** and **AI techniques** for **remote sensing applications in agriculture**, with an emphasis on **Agriculture and Environment**.

This tutorial is broken down into four parts as (coming soon youtube links):
1. Part 1: Fundamentals of Geospatial AI 
2. Part 2: Intermediate level and processing workflows
3. Part 3: Advanced Level and AI Pipelines
4. Part 4: Geospatial Foundation Models and future directions
